## SQL Implementation Details

### Advanced Query Techniques Used

#### 1. Window Functions
```sql
-- Performance ranking with percentiles
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY avg_score DESC) AS performance_rank,
PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY avg_score) AS percentile_rank,
NTILE(4) AS performance_quartile
```

#### 2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
```sql
-- Multi-level analysis with CTEs
WITH student_performance AS (
    SELECT student_id, AVG(score) AS avg_score
    FROM student_scores GROUP BY student_id
),
performance_categories AS (
    SELECT *, 
    CASE WHEN avg_score >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
         WHEN avg_score >= 80 THEN 'Good'
         ELSE 'Needs Improvement' END AS category
    FROM student_performance
)
```

#### 3. Advanced Joins
```sql
-- Multi-table joins with conditional logic
FROM students s
JOIN student_scores ss ON s.student_id = ss.student_id
JOIN exams e ON ss.exam_id = e.exam_id
LEFT JOIN subjects sub ON e.subject_id = sub.subject_id
```

#### 4. Statistical Functions
```sql
-- Statistical analysis
STDDEV(score) AS score_consistency,
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY score) AS median_score,
CORR(attendance_rate, score) AS attendance_performance_correlation
```

### Key Analytical Queries

#### Student Performance Ranking
- Ranks students using multiple criteria
- Calculates percentiles and quartiles
- Compares performance across grade levels
- Identifies top and bottom performers

#### Subject Difficulty Analysis
- Correlates expected vs actual difficulty
- Analyzes grade distributions
- Identifies subjects needing curriculum review
- Measures teacher effectiveness by subject

#### Trend Analysis
- Tracks performance over time
- Identifies improvement/decline patterns
- Seasonal performance variations
- Predicts future performance

#### Risk Assessment
- Early warning indicators
- Attendance correlation analysis
- Socioeconomic impact assessment
- Intervention effectiveness tracking

## Power BI Implementation

### Data Model Design
```
Fact Tables:
- student_scores (main fact table)
- attendance (secondary fact)

Dimension Tables:
- students (student demographics)
- subjects (academic subjects)
- teachers (instructor information)
- exams (assessment details)
- calendar (time dimension)
```

### Key Measures (DAX)
```dax
-- Performance metrics
Average Score = AVERAGE(student_scores[score])
Pass Rate = DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(student_scores, student_scores[score] >= 70)),
    COUNTROWS(student_scores)
) * 100

-- Trend analysis
Performance Trend = 
VAR CurrentPeriod = [Average Score]
VAR PreviousPeriod = CALCULATE([Average Score], PREVIOUSMONTH(calendar[Date]))
RETURN CurrentPeriod - PreviousPeriod

-- Risk indicators
High Risk Students = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(students[student_id]),
    FILTER(
        SUMMARIZE(student_scores, students[student_id], "AvgScore", [Average Score]),
        [AvgScore] < 70
    )
)
```

### Dashboard Features
1. **Executive Summary**: High-level KPIs and trends
2. **Student Details**: Individual performance tracking
3. **Subject Analysis**: Subject-wise performance metrics
4. **Teacher Effectiveness**: Instructor performance evaluation
5. **Risk Assessment**: Early warning and intervention tracking
