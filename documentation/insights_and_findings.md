## 3. Attendance Impact Analysis

### Attendance vs Performance Correlation
| Attendance Range | Average Score | Student Count | Risk Level |
|------------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| 95%+ | 91.2 | 45% | Low |

| 85-89% | 76.3 | 15% | Medium |
| 80-84% | 68.9 | 6% | High |
| <80% | 52.1 | 2% | Critical |

**Critical Finding**: Students with attendance below 85% show dramatically reduced academic performance. Every 1% decrease in attendance correlates with a 1.8-point drop in average scores.

### Recommendations:
- Implement early attendance intervention at 90% threshold
- Establish attendance recovery programs for students below 85%
- Investigate root causes of chronic absenteeism
