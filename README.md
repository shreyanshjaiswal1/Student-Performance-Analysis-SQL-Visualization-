# Student Performance Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced data analysis capabilities using SQL and Power BI to analyze student performance data. The analysis uncovers key insights about student outcomes, subject-wise performance trends, and factors influencing academic success.

## Key Features
- **Advanced SQL Analysis**: Complex queries using window functions, CTEs, joins, and aggregations
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**: Comprehensive visualization of performance trends
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Actionable recommendations for educators and administrators
- **Performance Metrics**: Grade distributions, improvement tracking, and comparative analysis

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL/MySQL for data analysis
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard development
- **Python**: Data generation and preprocessing (optional)
- **Excel**: Data validation and initial exploration

## Key Insights Delivered
1. **Performance Trends**: Identification of improvement/decline patterns
2. **Subject Analysis**: Comparative performance across different subjects
3. **Student Segmentation**: High, medium, and low performer categorization
4. **Predictive Indicators**: Factors that influence student success
5. **Actionable Recommendations**: Data-driven strategies for improvement

## Getting Started
1. Import the sample data using the provided SQL scripts
2. Execute the analysis queries in sequence
3. Open the Power BI dashboard template
4. Connect to your data source and refresh visualizations
